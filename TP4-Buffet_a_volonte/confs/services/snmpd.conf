# WARNING: If you uncomment the following lines you allow write access to your
# snmpd daemon from any source! To avoid this use different names for your
# community or split out the write access to a different community and
# restrict it to your local network.
# Also remember to comment the syslocation and syscontact parameters later as
# otherwise they are still read only (see FAQ for net-snmp).

# First, map the community name "public" into a "security name"
#       sec.name        source          community
com2sec readonly   default         tp4b2

# Second, map the security name into a group name:
#       groupName       securityModel   securityName
group   notConfigGroup  v1           notConfigUser
group   MyROGroup  v2c             readonly

# Third, create a view for us to let the group have rights to:
# Open up the whole tree for ro, make the RFC 1213 required ones rw.
#       name            incl/excl       subtree mask(optional)
view    systemview      included   .1.3.6.1.2.1.1

view    all             included        .1      80

# Finally, grant the group read-only access to the systemview view.
#       group          context sec.model sec.level prefix read   write  notif

# System contact information

# It is also possible to set the sysContact and sysLocation system
# variables through the snmpd.conf file:

syslocation Bordeaux, France
syscontact Root <root@localhost> (configure /etc/snmp/snmp.local.conf)

# Logging

# We do not want annoying "Connection from UDP: " messages in syslog.
# If the following option is commented out, snmpd will print each incoming
# connection, which can be useful for debugging.

# Process checks.
#
#  The following are examples of how to use the agent to check for
#  processes running on the host.  The syntax looks something like:
#
#  proc NAME [MAX=0] [MIN=0]
#
#  NAME:  the name of the process to check for.  It must match
#         exactly (ie, http will not find httpd processes).
#  MAX:   the maximum number allowed to be running.  Defaults to 0.
#  MIN:   the minimum number to be running.  Defaults to 0.

#  Make sure mountd is running
proc mountd

#  Make sure there are no more than 4 ntalkds running, but 0 is ok too.
proc ntalkd 4

#  Make sure at least one sendmail, but less than or equal to 10 are running.
proc sendmail 10 1

#  Note that the errorFlag for mountd is set to 1 because one is not
#  running (in this case an rpc.mountd is, but thats not good enough),
#  and the ErrMessage tells you what's wrong.  The configuration
#  imposed in the snmpd.conf file is also shown.
#
#  Special Case:  When the min and max numbers are both 0, it assumes
#  you want a max of infinity and a min of 1.

###############################################################################
# disk checks

# The agent can check the amount of available disk space, and make
# sure it is above a set limit.

# disk PATH [MIN=100000]
# PATH:  mount path to the disk in question.
# MIN:   Disks with space below this value will have the Mib's errorFlag set.
#        Default value = 100000.

# Check the / partition and make sure it contains at least 10 megs.
disk / 10000

###############################################################################
# load average checks

# load [1MAX=12.0] [5MAX=12.0] [15MAX=12.0]
# 1MAX:   If the 1 minute load average is above this limit at query
#         time, the errorFlag will be set.
# 5MAX:   Similar, but for 5 min average.
# 15MAX:  Similar, but for 15 min average.

# Check for loads:
load 12 14 14
